# Flappin-Em
A design that helps users rediscover and relive forgotten memories in a meaningful, engaging way 


This is a design with multiple features:
A memory map, that lets you hover around the world map to witness memories with respect to place, people, time and event

An AR VR setup, that enables to draft older photos into an embodiment that it feels a video

Connects your music application (spotify in this case) to your photos that resonate with same vibe

Galleries of every year

A feature of THIS DAY THAT YEAR, that shows the very same day over the past years
